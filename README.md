# Content Update Scheduler
WordPress plugin to schedule content updates for any page or post type.

## Description
**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Development of this plugin has been ceased because the plugin [Yoast Duplicate Post can now do the same](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/duplicate-post/#:~:text=New%3A%20Rewrite%20%26%20Republish,never%20been%20easier!) ("Rewrite & Republish" feature). If anyone wants to take over development of this plugin regardless, please contact me.
WordPress lacks a feature to schedule content updates. Keeping your posts and pages up to date manually can often waste your precious time, especially when you already know you'll soon have to update the same page again.

## Use Cases
- **Promotions:** Automatically publish versions of your pages that contain temporary promotions and schedule content updates where these promotions are removed as soon as they ended.
- **Events:** Schedule content updates for pages that list events. Automatically publish an updated version of the page after an event ended.
- **SEO:** Schedule series of content updates to keep your pages and publication dates up to date and satisfy the freshness algorithm.

## Key Features
- Updates page content and publication date
- Compatible with any post type
- Compatible with Elementor and Oxygen Builder
- Nested content updates (several updates of the same page scheduled in a row)
- Lightweight code
