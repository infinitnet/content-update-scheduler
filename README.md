# Content Update Scheduler
WordPress plugin to schedule content updates for any page or post type.

## Description
WordPress lacks the ability to schedule content updates. Manually updating your posts and pages can be a waste of time, especially if you know you'll have to update the same page again soon.

## Use Cases
- **Promotions:** Automatically publish versions of your pages that contain temporary promotions, and schedule content updates to remove those promotions once they expire.
- **Events:** Schedule content updates for pages that list events. Automatically publish an updated version of the page after an event ends.
- **SEO:** Schedule series of content updates to keep your pages and publishing dates current and satisfy the freshness algorithm.

## Key Features
- Updates page content and publishing date
- Compatible with any post type
- Works with Elementor and Oxygen Builder
- Nested content updates (multiple updates of the same page scheduled in a row)
- Lightweight code
